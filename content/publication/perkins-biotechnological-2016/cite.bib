 abstract = {Modern research has focused on the microbial transformation of a huge variety of organic compounds to obtain compounds of therapeutic and/or industrial interest. Microbial transformation is a useful tool for producing new compounds, as a consequence of the variety of reactions for natural products. This article describes the production of many important compounds by biotransformation. Emphasis is placed on reporting the metabolites that may be of special interest to the pharmaceutical and biotechnological industries, as well as the practical aspects of this work in the field of microbial transformations.},
