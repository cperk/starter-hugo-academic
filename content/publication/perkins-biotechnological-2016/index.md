abstract: Modern research has focused on the microbial transformation of a huge variety
  of organic compounds to obtain compounds of therapeutic and/or industrial interest.
  Microbial transformation is a useful tool for producing new compounds, as a consequence
  of the variety of reactions for natural products. This article describes the production
  of many important compounds by biotransformation. Emphasis is placed on reporting
  the metabolites that may be of special interest to the pharmaceutical and biotechnological
  industries, as well as the practical aspects of this work in the field of microbial
  transformations.
