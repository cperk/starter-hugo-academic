abstract: Streptomyces platensis MA7327 is a bacterium producing interesting antibiotics,
  which act by the novel mechanism of inhibiting fatty acid biosynthesis. The antibiotics
  produced by this actinomycete are platensimycin and platencin plus some minor related
  antibiotics. Platensimycin and platencin have activity against antibiotic-resistant
  bacteria such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant
  Enterococcus; they also lack toxicity in animal models. Platensimycin also has activity
  against diabetes in a mouse model. We have been interested in studying the effects
  of primary metabolites on production of these antibiotics in our chemically defined
  production medium. In the present work, we tested 32 primary metabolites for their
  effect. They included 20 amino acids, 7 vitamins and 5 nucleic acid derivatives.
  Of these, only l-aspartic acid showed stimulation of antibiotic production. We conclude
  that the stimulatory effect of aspartic acid is due to its role as a precursor involved
  in the biosynthesis of aspartate-4-semialdehyde, which is the starting point for
  the biosynthesis of the 3-amino-2,4-dihydroxy benzoic acid portion of the platensimycin
  molecule.
