abstract: 'Andromonoecy, a sexual system in which all individuals have both bisexual
  and male flowers, is found in at least four North American genera of Cleomaceae:
  Cleome L., Cleomella DC., Polanisia Raf., and Tarenaya Raf. This can be easily missed
  because the terms andromonoecious and andromonoecy are largely absent from the literature
  on these taxa. We conducted a series of experiments on how fruit set, mineral nutrition,
  mating, and herbivory affect male flower production in a cultivar of the North American
  cleomid Polanisia dodecandra (L.) DC. subsp. trachysperma (Torr. & A. Gray) Iltis.
  When we completely prevented fruit set during bisexual flower production, no male
  flowers were produced. If we allowed fruit maturation, plants would eventually switch
  to producing male flowers, then switch back to bisexual, and then continue alternating
  floral sex types as long as we allowed them to grow. Withholding mineral nutrients
  and simulating leaf herbivory each hastened the initial switch from bisexual to
  male flowers, but self-pollination did not delay it. Our results strongly indicate
  that in P. dodecandra subsp. trachysperma, male flower production is an evolutionary
  response to the regular occurrence of variation during the flowering season in the
  availability of photosynthates necessary for fruit maturation. It is likely that
  male flowers do contribute to male reproductive success through increased pollen
  export, but do not contribute to female reproductive success through increased deposition
  of pollen on the stigmas of bisexual flowers. More complete knowledge of the sexual
  systems and infrageneric relationships among North American cleomids, and in Cleomaceae
  as a whole, should provide interesting new insights into the evolution of sexual
  systems in angiosperms.'
