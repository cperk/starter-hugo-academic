    Title: Restoration on the Vassar Farm and Ecological Preserve; reforestation of an abandoned field, with goals to create a seed source, increase biodiversity, buffer nearby streams, and create a forest that is resilient to the effects of climate change.
    description: |2-
        
        * Site evaluation: to determine whether an abandoned four-acre field was a good candidate for reforestation, identified tree species in surrounding area and existing (mostly non-woody) species in the field, took soil samples to assess soil composition, and evaluated nearby stream buffers to assess erosion risk. 
        * Tree planting: Using the soil and moisture data, the field was split into four community types for planting: oak-hickory, mesic, red maple-sweet gum-black gum, and ﬂood plain forest.
        *Techniques: woody plant identification; transect sampling; stratified soil sampling; soil analysis; statistical analysis
